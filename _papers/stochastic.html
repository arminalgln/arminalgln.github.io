<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify">Energy crisis and global warming due to fossil fuel implementation in the energy production sector and
in the transportation sector have stimulated global trends to employ the electric vehicles (EVs) in the
transportation sector and renewable energy sources (RESs) in the power generation. Coordinated charging of EVs can bring some benefits by itself such as voltage and frequency regulation, spinning reserve,
load leveling, peak shaving, RESs support, GHG emission saving and so on. But implementation of this
scenario with uncoordinated EV charging which can impose a huge amount of excess load on the grid. In
this regard, EVs coordinated energy scheduling is inevitable. This paper comprehensively reviewed the
pros and cons of integrating EVs to the grid and recent investigations in EV energy scheduling especially
ones that focused on stochastic energy scheduling. Moreover, with knowing this fact that, microgrid with
the presence of different distributed generation (DG) such as RESs and a diverse storage system such as
EVs would have an important role in the future smart grid, thus, this paper aims to illustrate further research opportunities in this particular field. Also, different types of uncertain variables in recent studies
and mathematical methods for optimizing the relevant objective functions of EVs charging are reviewed
inclusively. Finally, future trends and investigation occasions in this field of study are discussed.
