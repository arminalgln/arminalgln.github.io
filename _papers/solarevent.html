<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    —Solar distribution feeders are commonly used in
    solar farms that are integrated into distribution substations.
    In this paper, we focus on a real-world solar distribution
    feeder and conduct an event-based analysis by using microPMU measurements. The solar distribution feeder of interest is a
    behind-the-meter solar farm with a generation capacity of over 4
    MW that has about 200 low-voltage distributed photovoltaic (PV)
    inverters. The event-based analysis in this study seeks to address
    the following practical matters. First, we conduct event detection
    by using an unsupervised machine learning approach. For each
    event, we determine the event’s source region by an impedancebased analysis, coupled with a descriptive analytic method. We
    segregate the events that are caused by the solar farm, i.e., locallyinduced events, versus the events that are initiated in the grid,
    i.e., grid-induced events, which caused a response by the solar
    farm. Second, for the locally-induced events, we examine the
    impact of solar production level and other significant parameters
    to make statistical conclusions. Third, for the grid-induced events,
    we characterize the response of the solar farm; and make
    comparisons with the response of an auxiliary neighboring feeder
    to the same events. Fourth, we scrutinize multiple specific events;
    such as by revealing the dynamics to the control system of the
    solar distribution feeder. The results and discoveries in this study
    are informative to utilities and solar power industry
