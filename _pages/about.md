I am a PhD candidate at the Universituy of California Riverside, in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, with Dr. Mohsenian-Rad. ​I received Deans Distinguished Fellowship Award from University of California Riverside. I completed my Master of Science in Energy Systems Engineering at University of Tehran and my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at Tehran Polytechnic University.

My research interests include developing data-driven methods and optimization-based techniques for power systems, such as time-series forecasting and anomaly detection. Specifically, I use unsupervised deep learning models in conjunction with optimization techniques to develop physics aware models in order to have more realistic and practical solutions for the smart grid problems. I am passionate about smartgrid, EV, renewable energy and generally sustainable development.
